  abstract = {La concentración espacial en Latinoamérica, especialmente en el cono sur, ha alcanzado niveles muy altos en todas sus dimensiones. A pesar del significativo crecimiento económico en las últimas dos décadas, apertura comercial, retorno a la democracia y reducción en el coeficiente de Gini, los índices de primacía de los países latinoamericanos permanecen relativamente constante y entre los más altos del mundo. Esta situación desafía las teorías provenientes de la economía urbana y regional que predicen una reducción en la concentración espacial a medida que avanza el desarrollo, después de un periodo inicial de concentración. Sin embargo, los países latinoamericanos parecieran estar atrapados en un proceso de aglomeración sin crecimiento. En este contexto, el objetivo de este trabajo es doble: por una parte, describe algunas de las características de la concentración espacial y su persistencia en América Latina con especial énfasis en el caso chileno; y por otra, se propone líneas de investigación futura relacionadas con la necesidad de re-balancear las economías espaciales enfocándolas en determinar a importancia de las instituciones como una explicación de la persistencia de la concentración espacial.  Spatial concentration in Latin America, especially in the southern cone, reaches high levels in all dimensions. Despite significant economic growth in the last two decades, trade openness, the return to democratic regimes and reductions in the Gini coefficients the primacy indexes of most Latin American countries remain relatively constant and among the highest in the world. This situation challenges most regional and urban economics theories that predict a reduction in spatial concentration as development proceeds, after an initial period of concentration. Furthermore, Latin American countries could be trapped in processes of agglomeration without growth. The objective of this article is twofold: first, we describe some characteristics of spatial concentration and its persistence in Latin America with special emphasis in the case of Chile; and second, we propose future research lines related to the need of rebalancing Latin American spatial economies focusing on the importance of institutions as an explanation of the persistence of spatial concentration.},

But structural transformation and urbanization patterns differ substantially, with some countries fostering migration out of agriculture into rural off farm activities and secondary towns, and others undergoing rapid agglomeration in mega cities. Using cross-country panel data for developing countries spanning 1980–2004, it is found that migration out of agriculture into the missing middle (rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns) yields more inclusive growth patterns and faster poverty reduction than agglomeration in mega cities. This suggests that patterns of urbanization deserve much more attention when striving for faster poverty reduction.},

We review theory and describe strengths and limits of recently proposed measures. We then propose a definition of vulnerability and develop a general empirical framework that combines Monte Carlo and bootstrap statistical techniques. The approach estimates the expected distribution of future expenditures for each household and then calculates vulnerability measures as a function of those distributions. The approach addresses weaknesses in existing methods, and can be implemented with panel data. An application to Côte d’Ivoire in 1985–86 shows that by our definition there was considerable vulnerability in the cities outside of Abidjan, a finding obscured by existing methods. – vulnerability ; poverty ; poverty measurement ; Côte d’Ivoire},

Specifically, we develop a simple theoretical model in which a public good is financed through proportional taxation, and that predicts a lower provision of public goods given an increase in the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE), which is widely recognized as a measure of the degree of economic persistence from one generation to the next in society. We test this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked about the replacement of the standing constitution by a new one that would potentially expand the role of the state in the provision of public goods. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution, even after controlling for median income and income inequality. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of society that exhibit higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards redistributive policies that increase public goods provision.},

  abstract = {The theory of inequality and intergenerational mobility presented in this essay assumes that each family maximizes a utility function spanning several generations. Utility depends on the consumption of parents and on the quantity and quality of their children. The income of children is raised when they receive more human and nonhuman capital from their parents. Their income is also raised by their "endowment" of genetically determined race, ability, and other characteristics, family reputation and "connections," and knowledge, skills, and goals provided by their family environment. The fortunes of children are linked to their parents not only through investments but also through these endowments acquired from parents (and other family members). The equilibrium income of children is determined by their market and endowed luck, the own income and endowment of parents, and the two parameters, the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest in children. If these parameters are both less than unity, the distribution of income between families approaches a stationary distribution. The stationary coefficient of variation is greater, the larger the degree of in-heritability and the smaller the propensity to invest in children. Intergenerational mobility measures the effect of a family on the well-being of its children. We show that the family is more important when the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest are larger. If both these parameters are less than unity, an increase in family income in one generation has negligible effects on the incomes of much later descendants. However, the incomes of children, grandchildren, and other early descendants could significantly increase; indeed, if the sum of these parameters exceeds unity, the changes in income rise for several generations before falling, and the maximum increase in income could exceed the initial increase.},

The index is built by combining three different techniques to reduce the spatial heterogeneity in housing: Quasi-experimental methods, hedonic prices and Fisher spatial price index. Using microdata from the Chilean survey CASEN 2006, it is shown that the quasi-experimental method called Mahalanobis metric within propensity score calipers (MMWPS) leads to a significant reduction in the potential bias. The technique matches dwellings of a particular region with other properties of similar characteristics in the benchmark region (Metropolitan region). Once the houses are matched, a hedonic price model is computed, and a regional housing price matrix is created using Fisher spatial price indices. The paper concludes the existence of price differentials for homogeneous houses across regions in Chile.},

  abstract = {We construct a public atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by the Census tract in which they grew up using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other out-comes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. Children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children with parents at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is \$5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how the tract-level data provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show how these data can be used to better target policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, information that can be used to design affordable housing policies. Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.},

  abstract = {We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.},
